This is the first homework assignment for ECE571, Introduction to System Verilog.

For this homework we are to create an arbiter slice module and test bench, a 4bit arbiter, one using behavioral and one using structural, a 4 bit test bench, and N bit arbiter using structural and a N bit Arbiter testbench.

Notes:
-Thursday: Coded working drafts of 1 bit arbiter slice. built tb and tested slice.  Confirmed that they work. 
-Friday: Coded working drafts of 4 bit structural arbiter and 4 bit behavioral arbiter.  Built tb and tested modules.  Confirmed that they work.
-Saturday: Plan to code Nbit Arbiter and TB.
-Sunday: Plan to comment code, add instructions to README, confirm that it conforms to requirements. Branch and attempt improvements.

-Ways to improve: Better pre planning for code.  Wasn't super necessary for this assignment but its a good habit to get into spending a day doing algorithms and Kmaps.
